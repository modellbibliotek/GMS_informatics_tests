					description = <"This archetype should be used to describe candidate variants or diagnosed causative variants. There is currently no standard variant nomenclature that can represent all kinds of genetic variation that is relevant to human medicine, science, and model organisms. Therefore, we represent variants using the keyword oneof, which is used in protobuf for an item with many optional fields where at most one field will be set at the same time. Variant messages contain an allele and the zygosity of the allele.

Alleles can be listed using HGVS, VCF, SPDI or ISCN notation. The phenopacket schema will implement the GA4GH Variation Representation Specification once that is mature. The VR-Spec will be the recommended option in some settings.

See: https://vr-spec.readthedocs.io/en/1.0rc/
See: https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification/blob/master/beacon.yaml
The Variant element itself is an optional element of a Phenopacket or Biosample. If it is present, the Phenopacket standard has the following requirements.

Alleles can refer to external sources, for example the ClinGen allele registry, ClinVar, dbSNP, dbVAR etc. using the id field. It is RECOMMENDED to use a CURIE identifier and corresponding Resource.

N.B. phase information for alleles are not represented in this model.">

For instance, if a variant affects one of two alleles at a certain locus, we could record the zygosity using the term heterozygous (GENO:0000135).">
